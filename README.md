# About the Project

## Project Goal

###  The goal of this project is to identify the drivers that determine the logerror of price of single family properties by constructing an ML Regression model with features from clustering.

## Project Description

### The cost of living and inflation is on the rise. The price of rent is also increasing and there is higher demand to purchase a home more than ever. Buyers want to find the home that works best for them. Buyers are using Zillow during their home buying journey to look for their potential new home. We will analayze data of homes that were purchased in the year 2017 from Zillow. The data will be helpful to determine factors that the logerror of a home. 

### Logerror is the following:

### Logerror = log(Zillow home estimate) - log(home value)

## Initial Questions

- Does the size of the lot and the square footage of the home impact the logerror?

- Does the county where the home is located impact the logerror?

- Does luxuary features like fireplace or pool impact the logerror of a home?

- Does the home being tax deliquent impact the log error?

## Steps to Reproduce

### The Plan
- Acquire the data
- Wrangle (prepare and clean) the data
- Split the data into three samples: `train`, `validate`, and `test`
- Conduct exploration of `train` sample and find relationships in data by plotting visuals and statistical testing
- Scale the `train` sample to normalize the values prior to modeling. Will transform `validate` and `test` samples also
- Explore the data
- Generate clusters from scaled `train` sample
- Generate model predictions by fitting models to only the scaled `train` and `validate` samples to avoid data leakage into `test` sample
- Evaluate the performance of the models with root mean square error (RMSE) calculation and pick the best performing model
- Evaluate the performance of best model.
- Draw conclusion


### Acquistion of zillow family home data

To acquire the zillow home data, I used the zillow_db in our mySQL server using the query below.

'''

    SELECT prop. *,
    predictions_2017.logerror,
    predictions_2017.transactiondate,
    air.airconditioningdesc,
    arch.architecturalstyledesc,
    build.buildingclassdesc,
    heat.heatingorsystemdesc,
    land.propertylandusedesc,
    story.storydesc,
    type.typeconstructiondesc
    FROM properties_2017 prop
    JOIN (
                SELECT parcelid, MAX(transactiondate) AS max_transactiondate
                FROM predictions_2017
                GROUP BY parcelid) pred USING(parcelid)
    JOIN predictions_2017 ON pred.parcelid = predictions_2017.parcelid
    AND pred.max_transactiondate = predictions_2017.transactiondate
    LEFT JOIN airconditioningtype air USING(airconditioningtypeid)
    LEFT JOIN architecturalstyletype arch USING(architecturalstyletypeid)
    LEFT JOIN buildingclasstype build USING(buildingclasstypeid)
    LEFT JOIN heatingorsystemtype heat USING(heatingorsystemtypeid)
    LEFT JOIN propertylandusetype land USING(propertylandusetypeid)
    LEFT JOIN storytype story USING(storytypeid)
    LEFT JOIN typeconstructiontype type USING(typeconstructiontypeid)
    WHERE propertylandusedesc IN ('Single Family Residential' , 'Mobile Home', 'Manufactured, Modular, Prefabricated Homes', 'Patio Home', 'Bungalow', 'Planned Unit Development') 
    AND transactiondate <= '2017-12-31'
    AND prop.longitude IS NOT NULL
    AND prop.latitude IS NOT NULL;

'''

- Should acquire raw dataset that has 54395 rows and 67 columns
- The query will bring null values

### Preparation of data

### Split the data

To split the data

- Split the refined dataframe into 3 samples using the train_test_split function from sklearn.model_selection using a random seed of "123"

### Scale the `train` sample and transform other samples using MinMax Scaler

-  Create function with columns to scale with code scale_columns = [ 'squarefeet', 'lot_size', 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms','garagecarcnt', 'fips_encoded', 'home_age' ]
-   made copy of each sample train_scaled = train.copy() , validate_scaled = validate.copy() , test_scaled = test.copy()
-  imported  sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler() as rbs
-  fit scaler object to `train` with code rbs.fit(train[scale_columns])
- transformed other samples with code :
    -  train_scaled[scale_columns] = rbs.transform(train[scale_columns])
    - validate_scaled[scale_columns] = rbs.transform(validate[scale_columns])
    - test_scaled[scale_columns] = rbs.transform(test[scale_columns])


### Make X_train and y_train

- Create x_train by using scaled train sample using code:
     - 

- Create y-train by using target variable only
     

### Modeling the data and evaluating which model performs the best on scaled `train` and `validate` samples
- from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression, LassoLars, TweedieRegressor 
- Create prediction DataFrames with the actual home value of `train`  and  home value baseline prediction by using the mean of the `home_value` in `train` sample
- Create prediction DataFrames with the actual home value of `validate` and  home value baseline prediction by using the mean of the `home_value` in `train` sample
- Create model object and fit model to `x_train` and ` y_train`
- Use the model object to make prediction on both scaled `train` and `validate` samples by omitting columns 'home_value', 'fips', 'year'.
- Add model predictions to both prediction dataframes created earlier
- Evaluate the performce of the models by using root mean square error (RMSE) on the predictions using similar code:
    - from scipy import stats
    - from math import sqrt
    - from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score, explained_variance_score
    - train_s_rmse = sqrt(mean_squared_error(home_value_mean['home_value'], home_value_mean.baseline))

    - def calculate_rmse(t):
        return sqrt(mean_squared_error(home_value_mean['home_value'], t))

    - print('Train baseline RMSE: {}.'.format(train_s_rmse))
    - home_value_mean.apply(calculate_rmse).sort_values()
- Review the results and pick the model with the lowest RMSE to run on scaled `test` sample

### Running best model on scaled `test` sample

- Create prediction DataFrame with the actual home value of `train`  and  home value baseline prediction by using the mean of the `home_value` in `train` sample
- Use the model object to make prediction on  scaled `test`  samples by omitting columns 'home_value', 'fips', 'year'.
- Add model predictions to both prediction dataframes created earlier
- Evaluate the performce of the models by using root mean square error (RMSE) on the predictions using similar code:
    - from scipy import stats
    - from math import sqrt
    - from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score, explained_variance_score
    - train_s_rmse = sqrt(mean_squared_error(home_value_mean['home_value'], home_value_mean.baseline))

    - def calculate_rmse(t):
        return sqrt(mean_squared_error(home_value_mean['home_value'], t))

    - print('Train baseline RMSE: {}.'.format(train_s_rmse))
    - home_value_mean.apply(calculate_rmse).sort_values()
- Review the results of model performance on scaled `test` sample
